# Distance Meter Hardware

The distance meter hardware project consists of a single printed circuit board (PCB) which
houses connectors for the hardware. A list of the hardware is available below. The PCB is
designed to be fastened within a project box.

Each piece of attached hardware is a complete built-up unit, and requires no supporting
circuitry.
